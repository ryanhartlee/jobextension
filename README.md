For example, if you are on Amazon, the extension will search for Amazon job postings on job board sites.

How to use:

Bring up the extensions management page: chrome://extensions.
If Developer mode has a + by it, click the +.
The + changes to a -, and more buttons and information appear.

Click the Load unpacked extension button.
A file dialog appears.

In the file dialog, choose the cloned directory.
Unless you get an error dialog, you've now installed the app.

Create a new tab.
The icon for the newly installed app appears in Google Chrome's launcher on the New Tab page. If the Apps area is minimized, then instead of the icon you specified, you should see the website favicon.

Click the icon for the app.
You've now launched the app. You should see its website in your browser window. If you don't, try changing the value of "web_url" in the manifest, reload the app, and click its icon again.
